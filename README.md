# Generalized Residuals

GENERALIZED RESIDUALS IN STATA

The goal of this new project is to program a user-written Stata command, which is suitable for the version 11 and upwards. Based on the methodological work of GOURIEROUX ET AL. (1987), the new command calculates generalized residuals from nonlinear models, such as the probit regression, ordered probit regression, or tobit regressions. 

Since there are different ways in Stata to do, for example, probit regressions, we have to consider the choice of the user within the program.
